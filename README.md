# espresso-cup

I started the "espresso" series a couple of years ago; it was kind of cafeine induced "I want to keep coding" thinking then estarted trying to implement a
state machine kind of software module; after several refactors and package re-structureS, I ended up rewriting in scala the latest code from one of the originals
java projects. Espresso-Cup is basically the helper code needed in most of the espresso modules. Right now it exports a logging trait and its SLF4 implementation trait.

It is shipped as osgi bundle by default.
